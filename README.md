# RESTful API Coffee Shop Project
An API that I programmed myself using a **SQL Database** and the **Flask Webframework**. The database handles information of Coffee shop (name, map_url, img_url, location, has_sockets, has_toilets, has_wifi, can_take_calls, seats and coffee_price). The API lets you call all coffee shops, a random coffee shop, a specific coffee shop (depending on your location), change the price of the coffee shop in a coffee shop and delete a coffee shop (if you have the API_KEY). *To change the **API KEY** simply go into the main.py and change the constant **API KEY** at the top of the document.*
You can also go to this documentation: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2568017/TVRhd9qR which I released to perhaps understand the API and its function to a better degree.
